# Snake-Game
The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where you control a snake that grows longer as it eats food. The goal is to avoid collisions with walls and the snakeâ€™s own body while collecting as much food as possible. The game features simple controls and increasing difficulty as the snake grows.
